# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
    Good visualization:
  - I think this visualization is equitable because it is fair and does not misrepresent the data 
    presented. However, it is not equitable because the visualization is not entirely accessible to everyone.
  - The visualization is reproducible in some aspects as the data sources used are included and can be accessed by 
    others. However, using Tableau over other visualization tools such as Matplotlib, where changes can be traced,         recreating the visualization exactly is not possible as the changes made by the author haven't been tracked.
  - In terms of accessibility, the visualization isn't accessible due to stylistic choices (colour and text) and           descriptive content is not clearly shown. 

    Bad visualization:
    - This visualization is equitable as it represents the data fairly and is simple enough to be easily accessible to        a wide variety of audiences.
    - This visualization is quite reproducible as it uses a simple visualization design, the data sources are included 
      and can be accessed by others. However similar to the good visualization, the changes made by the author can not 
      be tracked or accessed due to the use of Tableau.
    - The visualization is accessible as the information is clearly shown, making it accessible to a wider 
      audience. However, using colour to differentiate between different social media platforms could make the
      visualization difficult to view for those with colour blindness. 


        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
       Good visualization:
        - While the design of the visualization ties into the topic, the visualization could be made more accessible 
          by using a simpler design such as easier-to-read text/font. 
        - To keep the same design but improve accessibility, alt-text and captions could be clearly shown rather than 
         the audience having to hover over icons to view text (which could be a problem for people with screen 
         readers).
        - To improve reproducibility, the visualization could be created using a tool where the changes and choices 
          made by the author were tracked and easily accessible to the audience.
        - The equitability of the visualization could be improved by implementing the changes above. 

       Bad visualization
        - The visualization could be made more accessible by changing the colours used to represent the various social 
          media platforms to colours that could be more easily seen by people with colour blindness.
        - To improve reproducibility, the visualization could be created using a tool where the changes and choices 
          made by the author were tracked and easily accessible to the audience. 


        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
