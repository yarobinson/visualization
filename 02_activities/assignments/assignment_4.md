# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify:

## Python visualization is located in the participation folder labelled as Scarborough TPL Visits in 2022
## My Tableau visualization is located [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yasmine.robinson/viz/TorontoPublicLibraryVisitsin2022/Sheet1#1)
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
- I used matplotlib to create my bar chart visualization as this was a straightforward method to generate the visualization.
- I used Tableau for my map visualization as I knew that Tableau had the features I needed to create my visualization in map form

    > Who is your intended audience?
  - My intended audience for my bar chart are those interested in visiting data for libraries in the Scarborough area
  - My intended audience for my map is audiences interested in the locations of Toronto's least and most visited libraries
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?
  - In my bar chart, I am trying to convey the differences in traffic between various libraries in Scarborough
  - In my Tableau visualization, I am trying to convey the levels of volume between libraries across Toronto through the size and colour of data points. 
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?
    - 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?
    - My bar chart is more reproducible then my Tableau visualization as I used 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?
  When creating my data visualizations, I considered colour, text 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    - City of Toronto employees tasked with tracking the visits to each library in Toronto
    - The teams tasked with putting together the TPL visits dataset and uploading it to the site

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
